## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Utility-first approach


### What I learned

I continue looking for ways to organize code and project files.

On this specific project, I looked at splitting css between multiple files and using a utility-first approach.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice organization and architecture until I find a structure that resonates with my usual modular approach to software development.
